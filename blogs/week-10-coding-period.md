# Coding Period Week-10

The final week of the coding period turned out to be one of the busiest ones. The weekly mentor-mentee meeting did not occur this week because the mentors were preoccupied with other tasks.

We spent most of our time implementing the various suggestions that the mentors gave at the end of [week-09](week-09-coding-period.md). The suggestions mainly focused on code reuse and optimizations.

The suggestions also made adding support for a new language to MARS quite easy.

Steps:

1. Create YAML and cover file
1. Add new language dictionary to `word-translations.yml`
3. Add language package to the header file

 More details regarding this can be found [here](https://github.com/chaoss/MARS/blob/main/automation/add-language_README.md).

Other than that, we were able to finalize the translations process. The release team and the translation team discussed the final procedure, after which the guidelines were added to the [handbook](https://handbook.chaoss.community/community-handbook/community-initiatives/metrics/translation). 

We also created a [FAQ page](https://handbook.chaoss.community/community-handbook/community-initiatives/metrics/metrics-faq) that clears most of the doubts anyone might have regarding the process.

This marked the end of the coding period. We would be focussing on cleaning up any of the leftover work in the next week.
