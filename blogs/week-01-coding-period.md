## Coding Period- Week 1 

The approach of the automation system was discussed with the mentors and was formed by combining the two proposals (Ritik & mine).

We would be using YML files that would be the main source of input information. The processing of the required files would be done in a tree-like structure with a hierarchy involving working groups, focus areas, and metrics. Thanks to Georg for suggesting these ideas!

Since the implementation requires us to collaborate, I decided to explore through Ritik's approach and gain an understanding of it. I was successfully able to replicate the required results.

I am mainly focussing on the translated metrics hence I decided to run some tests. There was an issue with Chinese translations since the writing characters are different. More details - [#2](https://github.com/yash2002109/chaoss-workspace/issues/2)

We plan to use [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) for converting markdowns to PDF. I noticed that the tables do not wrap. The text overflows out from the page. This will require further investigation and feedback from the mentors.
