# Coding Period- Week 7

This week's meeting involved discussions mainly around the process of translating metrics. The key points being:
- How should the English metrics release team signal a metric needs to be translated?
- How do the translation teams signal that the translations are ready for release?
- What does the lifecycle of this process look like in comparison with the regular metrics release (simultaneous or up to 2 months following English release)?
- Do we need a review period for the translated metrics?

We were also able to complete MARS and prepare it for user testing. We completed the documentation and conducted some tests to ensure that everything was functioning properly.

Before we started working on MARS for translations, we decided that allowing users to operate the entire process on their own computer would be a good idea. Keeping this in mind we started the standardization of translated metrics first.

I made some PRs in the translations repository:

- Common Metrics WG-  [chaoss/translations/#30](https://github.com/chaoss/translations/pull/30)
- DEI WG- [chaoss/translations/#31](https://github.com/chaoss/translations/pull/31)
- Evolution WG- [chaoss/translations/#32](https://github.com/chaoss/translations/pull/32)
- Risk WG- [chaoss/translations/#33](https://github.com/chaoss/translations/pull/33)
- Value WG- [chaoss/translations/#34](https://github.com/chaoss/translations/pull/34)

Some of the translations currently lack the requisite README files. I made a provisional README file with placeholders that the translations team can update later.

The translations team replied swiftly, and all of the above PRs were merged as a result of their efforts. ðŸŽ‰

I intend to work on the second part of MARS for the release of the translations during the next week.
