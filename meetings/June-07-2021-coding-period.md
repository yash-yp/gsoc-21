## Meeting 1- June 07, 2021

The mentor/mentee meeting happened for the first time on day 1. It was very productive since we were able to work out the framework of the project and managed to find a common approach. This approach was combined from both the proposals (Ritik & mine).

We plan to create a Slack Channel for quick communication and reviews.

It was decided that I would be taking the lead on the automation of the translated metrics. As of now, We're looking to generate one report for each language.
