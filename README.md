## Project Abstract

[CHAOSS](https://github.com/chaoss) metrics have been defined to provide an in-depth view into the various features of an open-source project.

 The metrics are very useful as with the growing popularity of open-source projects, it is becoming increasingly difficult to keep track of the needs of the project, its implementation and its requirements for the future. 

These metrics are released biannually in the form of reports. The main aim of the project is to understand the metrics release process, propose process improvements and automate the release process of these metrics.
